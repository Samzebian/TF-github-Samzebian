<p id="cover letter"> Working in the Health industry  is a dream that I have had since the time I started learning. 

I am interested in a career that challenges, teaches and inspires people who are proud to provide their talent and time to. 
<br>
<br>
I’m currently a graduate of UMASS and have worked in the Health field, both in inpatient care, consulting and massage therapy. I have been a successful support representative for the time I spent in school, and I’ve spent time in a few other fields of health. I also have experience in business and troubleshooting. I currently manage my own business in radiology, as well as joined a program called Health Foundry in Austin to train and polish my health skills.
<br>
<br>
I am delighted to work with people and health, bringing them together to help make people's lives better. I can coordinate, manage and troubleshoot most human or health-related issues necessary for this field, and I would analyze what the best, most efficient solutions would be.
